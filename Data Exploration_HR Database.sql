SELECT employeename, dateofhire
FROM hrdata
ORDER BY dateofhire ASC
LIMIT 5;

--2. who is the employee with the longest tenure (using reference date 2018-07-09 as present date)
-- Jack Torrence is the longest employed having 12 years and 6 months in service

SELECT employeename, 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE('2018-07-09'::DATE, dateofhire)) AS tenure_year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE('2018-07-09'::DATE, dateofhire)) AS tenure_months
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active'
ORDER BY tenure_year DESC;


--3. Top 10 employees with the most absences
--It appears there are 14 employees with the same rate of absences. 20 being the highest.

SELECT employeename, absences
FROM hrdata
ORDER BY absences DESC;


--4. Average employee satisfaction of Active employees.
-- Average score is 3.89

SELECT AVG(empsatisfaction)
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active';

-- Curious about the average employee sastisfaction of Voluntary Terminated employees.
-- Average score is 3.89 as well.

SELECT AVG(empsatisfaction)
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Voluntarily Terminated';

--not much outliers between those who left and those are still active.

--5. What is the shortest tenure of an active employee
-- Randy Dee appears to be the employee with the shortest tenure

SELECT employeename, 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE('2018-07-09'::DATE, dateofhire)) AS tenure_year,

FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active'
ORDER BY tenure_year ASC;


--6. What is the percentage of difference of active male and females in the workplace
-- it appears females are the more dominant active employees. Females are 116, males are 91

SELECT
    sex,
    COUNT(*) AS active_count,
    (COUNT(*)::numeric / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()) * 100 AS percentage
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active'
GROUP BY sex;

--7. What is the average salary band of each department?

SELECT department.department, AVG(hrdata.salary) AS Average_Salary
FROM hrdata
INNER JOIN department ON department.department_id = hrdata.department_id
GROUP BY department.department

--8. Aggregated Performance Scores of Tenured and Resigned Employees.

SELECT performancescore, COUNT(performancescore)
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active'
GROUP BY performancescore;

--9. Top Recruitment source of possible applicants.
--Indeed was the top source for all employees.

SELECT recruitmentsource, COUNT(recruitmentsource) AS source_count
FROM hrdata

ORDER BY source_count DESC;

--10. What is the total number of employees, including active and inactive. Find their difference

SELECT COUNT(employeeid) AS total_employee_count
FROM hrdata;
--311 employees in total

SELECT COUNT(employeeid) AS total_active_employee
FROM hrdata
WHERE employmentstatus = 'Active';
--207 Active employees

SELECT COUNT(employeeid) AS total_active_employee
